## 3️⃣  When and Why to Use This Approach

### ✅ **When / Why it Works**
1. **Information synthesis and summarization** – Condensing large volumes of research or medical records.  
2. **Rapid idea generation** – Brainstorming hypotheses, study designs, or lesson plans.  
3. **Accessibility and education** – Simplifying specialized content for non‑experts or multilingual users.  
4. **Programming productivity** – Rapid debugging and learning in multiple programming languages.  
5. **Pre‑publication assistance** – Improving clarity, grammar, or structure before human peer review.

### 🛑 **When / Why It May Fail**
1. **Tasks needing factual precision (diagnosis, policy forecasting)** – risk of confident but wrong answers.  
2. **Sensitive data contexts** – patient, student, or citizen information without strong privacy controls.  
3. **Ethical review or decision‑making** – models lack contextual judgement and accountability.  
4. **Situations requiring originality or citations** – plagiarism or fabricated sources possible.  
5. **Technical reasoning without grounded data** – no verification of calculations or model validity.

## 5️⃣  Technical Interview Questions & Model Answers

### **Q1. Explain in simple terms how a large language model like ChatGPT works, and why it’s so effective for text‑based tasks.**
**Answer:**  
An LLM predicts the next word in a sentence based on all previous words. It uses a *Transformer architecture*—layers of "attention" that decide which prior words matter most for each prediction. Because it’s trained on vast text data—billions of examples—it learns grammar, facts, and reasoning patterns, making it capable of writing, summarizing, and answering questions in natural language.

---

### **Q2. The paper calls ChatGPT a “double‑edged sword.” What does that mean technically and ethically?**
**Answer:**  
Technically, it means ChatGPT drastically increases efficiency—fast data analysis, writing, and coding—but can also amplify errors, bias, or misuse at the same scale.  
Ethically, the same tool that democratizes access to knowledge can spread misinformation or violate privacy if misapplied. The duality emphasizes the need for **responsible deployment and human governance**.

---

### **Q3. In what ways can ChatGPT support scientific publishing without replacing peer review or human authorship?**
**Answer:**  
It can summarize literature, rewrite abstracts for readability, translate scientific text, check grammar, or suggest structure improvements.  
It should not generate results, fabricate citations, or appear as an author. Proper use treats the AI as an *assistant tool*—like automated grammar software—while maintaining full human accountability.

---

### **Q4. Discuss three engineering controls you would implement to ensure ethical use of ChatGPT in healthcare applications.**
**Answer:**  
1. **Data Anonymization & Encryption:** Strip patient identifiers before data leaves the system.  
2. **Human‑in‑the‑Loop Review:** Require clinician approval before outputs influence patients.  
3. **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG):** Link model answers to validated medical databases, preventing hallucinations and ensuring traceable evidence.

---

### **Q5. When using ChatGPT for programming support, how can developers ensure safety and correctness of AI‑generated code?**
**Answer:**  
- **Sandbox Execution:** Test all AI‑generated snippets in isolated environments.
